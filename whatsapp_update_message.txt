🎉 COMMISSION REPORT UPDATE - MAJOR ENHANCEMENT! 🎉

Hey team! 👋

Just deployed a HUGE improvement to our commission reporting system! 🚀

🔥 WHAT'S NEW:

✅ SMART FILTERING - Now you can filter commissions by:
• "Paid Only" = Actual earned commissions (money in bank) 💰
• "Posted Only" = Forecast commissions (expected earnings) 📊
• "All Posted" = Complete sales pipeline view 📈

✅ BETTER FORECASTING:
• See projected commissions from unpaid invoices
• Track actual vs expected earnings
• Perfect for sales planning & cash flow! 💡

✅ NEW DEFAULT:
• Reports now show "Posted Only" by default
• Gives you forecast view first (most requested!) 📋

🎯 BUSINESS IMPACT:
• Better sales forecasting
• Clear separation of actual vs projected earnings
• Complete commission pipeline visibility
• Enhanced business intelligence 📊

🔧 WHERE TO FIND IT:
Sales → Reporting → Commission Financial Report

Try the new filters and see your commission data in a whole new way!
